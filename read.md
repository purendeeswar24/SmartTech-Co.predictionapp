# **Laptop Price Prediction and Tips**

## **Overview**

The **Laptop Price Prediction and Tips** application is a web-based tool built using **Streamlit**, designed to predict the price of a laptop based on various specifications. Additionally, the app provides personalized care and maintenance tips for different laptop brands. The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the price of the laptop based on user input.

---

## **Features**

- **Price Prediction**: Predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications such as brand, type, screen size, RAM, storage, GPU, and more.
- **Brand-Specific Tips**: Provides personalized maintenance and care tips for different laptop brands like Apple, HP, Acer, Dell, and others.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive user interface with input options for all major laptop specifications.
- **Responsive Design**: Attractive design with custom CSS to enhance the user experience.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Streamlit**: A Python library to build web applications with minimal code.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used to create and train the machine learning model that predicts the price.
- **Joblib**: To load the pre-trained model for predictions.
- **Numpy**: Used for numerical operations and data transformations.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to improve the visual appearance of the app.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow the steps below to run the app locally:

### **1. Install Dependencies**

First, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. Then, create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Install the required libraries
pip install streamlit joblib numpy scikit-learn
```

### **2. Download or Clone the Repository**

Clone or download the repository containing the `app.py` script and the pre-trained machine learning model (`laptop.pkl`). The `laptop.pkl` model file should be placed in the same directory as the `app.py` script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-prediction
```

### **3. Run the Application**

Once all dependencies are installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser.

### **4. Using the App**

Once the app is running, you will see an interactive sidebar where you can enter the specifications of the laptop. You can input the following details:

- **Company**: Select the brand of the laptop (e.g., Apple, Dell, HP).
- **Type**: Choose the type of laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming).
- **Screen Size**: Select the screen size in inches.
- **RAM**: Choose the amount of RAM.
- **Storage**: Select the type and capacity of storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).
- **GPU**: Select the GPU type.
- **Operating System**: Choose the operating system.
- **Weight**: Specify the weight of the laptop.
- **Resolution**: Select the screen resolution.
- **Clock Speed**: Enter the clock speed of the CPU.
- **CPU Brand**: Choose the CPU brand (e.g., Intel, AMD).
- **CPU Type**: Select the type of CPU (e.g., i3, i5, i7).

After selecting the specifications, click on the **"Predict Price"** button to get the predicted price of the laptop. The result will be displayed in an attractive format, along with personalized care tips for the selected brand.

## **App Functionality**

- **Price Prediction**: The app predicts the price of a laptop based on a machine learning model trained on various features.
- **Care Tips**: For each selected brand, the app provides useful care tips for maintaining the laptop. For example:
  - Apple: "ðŸ“± Always use a soft microfiber cloth to clean your MacBook."
  - Dell: "ðŸ”‹ Use Dell's Power Manager to improve battery life."

## **Customizing the App**

- **Changing Colors**: You can customize the colors by modifying the CSS styles within the `app.py` file.
  
- **Updating the Model**: If you want to update the price prediction model (`laptop.pkl`), you can retrain the model using additional data and save it using `joblib`. Ensure the updated model is placed in the same directory as `app.py`.
